<!-- 
    Thank you for publishing your work on Hexo site!
    
    We also welcome you to transfer your repo into hexojs org, and you also could become hexojs member. You will still be the repo admin, but also gain access to hexojs other repoes. 
    
    There are several benifits to do so:
    1. Become Hexojs org member, and gain access to all hexojs repos.
    2. Other Hexojs members could help to maintain issues and review PRs.
    3. More wait you to discover... :)
    
    Please contact @NoahDragon if interested this opputunity.
